I started to developed this program with the idea in mind of creating an animation engine similar to the fantastic [[https://github.com/3b1b/manim][manim]], to put my own spin on mathematical visualization. I am using the [[https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d][panda3d]] engine, which is a game engine developed in C++, with Python bindings. 

So far, this program can do basic things like drawing arrays of vectors, or small animations like this one:

It can also convert a string in python to a LaTeX formula to a pdf to an svg file, then reads that in and renders it as polygons (supports right now only very basic shapes, i.e. letters with one hole).

* Installation
- Clone this repository
- Create a =virtualenv= (e.g. named =venv=) with =python3=, (e.g. in your current folder =.=, the project's root folder): 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python3 -m venv .
#+END_SRC

- Activate the virtual environment, e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
source ./bin/activate
#+END_SRC

- install the dependencies listed in =requirements.txt=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
#+END_SRC


* Notes
** Branched Podcast Idea
*** DONE Plot a parametric curve
**** TODO Plot a dashed parametric curve
Think about how to plot this in a reasonable way (or compare with how matplotlib does it, it actually bends dashes over the corners of a line going through a point). I could try to extend my createColoredParametricDashedCurveGeomNode, but it seems pretty complicated, and I sunk already too much time into that. 
**** TODO Plot differently colored parametric curves
*** Plot a bezier curve
*** implement coulomb repulsion of particles with strong damping
*** map an mp3 file along a bezier curve
** deferred tasks
*** DEFERRED Plot the Bloch sphere
*** DEFERRED triangulation of latex characters
Probe, at what complexity the p3d triangulation breaks. To decrease the complexity (geometry simplification) and check for intersections of hole polygon with boundary polygon, use the shapely library.

*** DEFERRED Make rectangle class
**** DONE draw a rectangle made of lines
**** DEFERRED Make it automatically encompass things
**** Implement a 'scene2d' type class
- to plot a coordinate system in (and fit inside the viewport)
- properties: 
  - default height and width
  - default anchor point
  - background color
  - white frame
  - function to fit stuff in it

** possilbe optimizations
*** MAYBE Draw a black circle and black dot as part of the Cone tip
*** MAYBE Figure out how to make an object keep facing the camera, keeping it's local origin fixed
*** MAYBE create the shaded triangulated Cone procedurally instead of loading it from a model file
(see e.g. https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/blob/ebaa197c135c7055710503d47d389526eb7ed580/src/Open3D/Geometry/TriangleMeshFactory.cpp)
*** MAYBE calculate surface normals manually for the cone (for flat shading)
