* tex_quads
The first idea is to create another animation engine, so that I can put my own spin on mathematical visualization (maybe similar to [[https://github.com/3b1b/manim][manim]]).
Afer early attempts at building [[https://github.com/ctschnur/first-graphics-engine][my own rendering engine]] in ~C++~, I am for now basing this on the much more complete [[https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d][panda3d]] game engine (initially developed by Disney, written in ~C++~, having DirectX and OpenGL backends and python bindings).

So far, the functionality is still pretty basic. This is a sample (3d interactive Bezier Curves and extrusion of a parametric curve): 

[[file:screenshots/Peek4.gif]]

This program can also display ~LaTeX~ equations on-screen. One long term goal is to enable computer-assisted manipulation of mathematical expressions and parallel visualization. 

* Installation
- Clone this repository
- Create a =virtualenv= (e.g. named =venv=) with =python3=, (e.g. in your current folder =.=, the project's root folder): 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python3 -m venv .
#+END_SRC

- Activate the virtual environment, e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
source ./bin/activate
#+END_SRC

- install the dependencies listed in =requirements.txt=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

* Notes
** Branched Podcast Idea
*** DONE Plot a parametric curve
*** DONE Make blender-like side, top, front view (map to number keys)
*** DONE Plot a dashed parametric curve
*** DONE Draw 2d bezier curve with handles
*** DONE implement force-directed graph plotting
**** DONE draw a graph by using networkx for the layout generation
**** DONE make individual nodes of the graph draggable
**** on-hover highlighting of a line and plotting a cursor
***** DONE on-hover highlighting of the closest infinite straight line
***** DONE pin text (parametric value between 0 and 1) to the hovering cursor
***** DONE on-hover highlighting of the closest finite straight line
***** DONE substitute Line1dSolid edges by vector edges
****** DONE Write a dynamic setTailPoint and setTipPoint for Vector
****** DONE remove the artifact (1., 0., 0.)
***** DONE Toggle play/pause
****** DONE render play/pause label and toggle using spacebar
****** DONE figure out how a sequence works
****** DONE render a play/pause cursor at a 'current position'
****** DONE write a class that gets and sets the state appropriately, together with a state machine
***** DONE write state machine for a single edge
****** DONE accentuate the cursor by drawing a black and white circle around it
****** DONE implement cursor clicking
****** DONE implement cursor dragging along a line
****** DONE Write EdgePlayer, inheriting EdgePlayerState
****** DONE Write a state machine for a single edge for playback
****** DONE Fix the Line drawing upon reversal of the order setTipPoint <-> setTailPoint
***** TODO Make a recording function for an EdgePlayer
****** TODO make a line that grows from just a point and on stop-recording makes a loose edge
******* TODO Implement EdgeRecorder and EdgeRecorderState
******** DONE debug the state
1. give EdgePlayer a new update_function (similar to the EdgeRecorder one) that depends on a speed, not just on two points and a parameter between [0, 1]
   - make the standard rate of playing a constant in the EdgePlayer class
2. make a function that changes the v1, a, duration and so on of the EdgePlayer to the values of the EdgeRecorder
****** TODO Record an audio file using python
****** TODO make two simultaneous threads: one for rendering, one for audio recording
the rendering thread (from which the recording thread is spawned) renders an animation while the recording thread records. The recording thread needs to be sent a signal to stop the recording, (p3d Directobject?)
***** TODO Extend the EdgePlayer To a GraphPlayer made of many edges and one EdgePlayer at a time


*** WAITING implement on-hover highlighting of a particular bezier curve 
**** WAITING curve picking
Strategy to achieve curve picking: 
- build a tube mesh along an arbirary path: 
  - advance in +equidistant path-length+ segments along the path of a smooth continuous curve and at each point
    - plot a point (1.)
    - plot a circle (2.)
    - +find the basis of unit vectors at each point of the path (t_vec points along the tangent, n_vec points along the direction of max. radius of curvature (see e.g. [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenetsche_Formeln#Frenetsche_Formeln_in_Abh%C3%A4ngigkeit_von_anderen_Parametern][Frenet-Serret formulas]], with $s=t$) and b_vec = t_vec cross n_vec) and plot it+
    - find the tangent vectors, generate the circles perpendicular to them, with naive choice of the start-vertex of each circle
    - bulid the triangle mesh in a for loop (always accessing the last circle's coordinates last_circle_coords)

Fixable Problems: 
- the tube folds over when the curvature becomes much larger than the distance between two segments. +To make the internal rotation of the circles (that are connected to each other) more consistent, one could always rotate the first point of the circle to lie along the curvature vector or opposite from it directly after the curvature switches.+ 

alter the position of the cursor along the path by dragging horizontally (horizontal dragging distance maps to path length advancement at first, with quadratic increase in dragging speed when the dragging accelerates)

- properties: 
  - default height and width
  - default anchor point
  - background color
  - white frame
  - function to fit stuff in it

** possilbe optimizations
*** MAYBE Draw a black circle and black dot as part of the Cone tip
*** MAYBE Figure out how to make an object keep facing the camera, keeping it's local origin fixed
*** MAYBE create the shaded triangulated Cone procedurally instead of loading it from a model file
(see e.g. https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/blob/ebaa197c135c7055710503d47d389526eb7ed580/src/Open3D/Geometry/TriangleMeshFactory.cpp)
*** MAYBE calculate surface normals manually for the cone (for flat shading)
