Converting LaTeX formulas from pdf form to svg to eventually polygons
and rendering them in panda3d.

TODO Notes:

Tue Sep 4 00:07:19 CEST 2018: Probe, at what complexity the p3d
triangulation breaks. To decrease the complexity (geometry
simplification) and check for intersections of hole polygon with
boundary polygon, use the shapely library.

Installation: 

- Clone this repository

- Create a =virtualenv= (e.g. named =venv=) with =python3=, (e.g. in your current folder =.=, the project's root folder): 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python3 -m venv .
#+END_SRC

- Activate the virtual environment, e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
source ./bin/activate
#+END_SRC

- install the dependencies listed in =requirements.txt=, which results from me running 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
cat requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| numpy==1.16.1        |
| panda3d==1.10.1      |
| pkg-resources==0.0.0 |
| pyparsing==2.3.1     |
| svgpathtools==1.3.3  |
| svgwrite==1.2.1      |

within my active virtual environment: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

Now, if I have kept the =requirements.txt= up-to-date, it may run.
