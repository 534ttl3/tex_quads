-> 
in the add_event, transition_into and add_batch_events calls, only add or do the transition_into if the state machine where this function was called from (so either None->self or explicitly set by called_from_sm) is the .get_controlling_sm (which can be self or another one). If the called_from_sm is the .get_controlling_state_machine, then add the event/do the transition_into
